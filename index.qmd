## R/Pharma

R/Pharma conference is a relatively small, scientifically & industry oriented, collegial event focused on the use of R in the development of pharmaceuticals.

The first conference took place in 2018, as an in-person event hosted by Harvard. During Covid-19, the 
conference moved to be online, and grew in participation to more than 1,500 data scientists from the 
pharma world with a passion for using R.

The conference is free to attend, and all hosting costs are met by contributions by 
Pharma companies.
